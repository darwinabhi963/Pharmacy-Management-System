# Pharmacy-Management-System
A user interface developed using NetBeans IDE and programmed using Java Data Base Connectivity (JDBC). This project uses MySQL for backend manipulation and data retrieval, and Java for programming the functionalities of the components of the user interface, including jButtons, etc. 
The application program can allow the user to view medicines available by retrieving the same from the database, and can also allow the user to select the medicine and a quantity of it to a virtual cart, thereby simulating an online pharmacy store.
